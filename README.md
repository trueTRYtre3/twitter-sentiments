"# twitter-sentiments" 
Project Built using JavaScript (React) for frontend and Python (Flask) for backend.
This project explores twitter sentiment regarding a requested topic through the use of an NLTK library, specifically through the use of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. Color coded tweets are returned to the user based on the compound score, showing how different tweets feel about a given topic.

Color map: 
  * tweets with green border - positive sentiment
  * tweets with gray border - neutral sentiment
  * tweets with red border - negative sentiment
